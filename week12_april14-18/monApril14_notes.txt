Exam 2 topics:

- Being able to draw a control by looking at XAML
- Being able to define the XAML for a basic control
    Common WPF elements -- Grid, StackPanel, DockPanel, TextBlock, TextBox, 
        Button, CheckBox, ComboBox

- Partial classes, including XAML and the code-behind
- Composition of WPF controls
- The elements tree
- DataContext
- Data binding


****INotifyPropertyChanged and INotifyCollectionChanged, including how and when to 
    invoke PropertyChanged and how to listen to the PropertyChanged of another object

    --> example: how does Order listen to PropertyChanged of its items?

we did this in Order's Add:
    item.PropertyChanged += OurEventHandler;

    also, invoke PropertyChanged for Subtotal, Tax, Total

Then we would write:

    private void OurEventHandler(object sender, PropertyChangedEventArgs e) {
        //look at e.PropertyName, if it was "Price":
            //invoke PropertyChanged for: Subtotal, Tax, Total
    }




***Events, including custom events, custom event arguments (extends RoutedEventArgs), invoking events, 
    attaching event handlers to events, and using events to send messages between 
    objects


- MVVM (the ideas)
- Testing the PropertyChanged event
- UML for WPF projects
- Integration testing (the ideas)
 

Mix of multiple choice and "open-ended"
