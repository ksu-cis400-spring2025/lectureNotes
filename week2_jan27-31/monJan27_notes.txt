Encapsulation tutorial: due tonight
Properties tutorial: due Tuesday
Milestone 1: due Friday (you might notice the design is ugly...)

--> make sure your project builds (but it won't run)

--> save your files!

--> how to check what you submitted?

--> what if you need to re-release? v0.1.1, etc.

--> "you are ahead of branch main..."

----------------------------

Properties.


--> autoproperty

public int Num {get; set;}

    equivalent to?



--> how to control visibility?


--> how to set default values?

---------------------------

Common mistake with properties:

public int Property
{
    get
    {
        return Property;
    }
    set
    {
        Property = value;
    }
}

obj.Property;

See LabRoom class. Turn fields into properties.
--> enforce room size 10-30
--> make Windows value get-only (except on creation)
    1) using a constructor
    2) using init


------------------------------

static vs non-static.

    --> when can/should a field/method/property be static?
    --> when is a field/method/property NOT allowed to be static?
    --> when should a class be static?

--> can a static class have a constructor?

--> can a non-static class have a static constructor?


--> what if we wanted a consistent drinks policy (yes/no) across all
    lab rooms?


--> how could we initialize the drink policy for everyone?


--> how could we modify the drinks policy for everyone?


---------------------------------------------

Want to keep track of scores and majors for students.
